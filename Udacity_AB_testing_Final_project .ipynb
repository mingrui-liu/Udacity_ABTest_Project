    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.\n",

However, in general, this is not a risky experiment as the change would not be expected to cause a precipitous drop in enrollment. In terms of timing, an 18 day experiment is more reasonable, but % diversion may be scaled down depending on other experiments of interest to be performed concurrently."

    "# Summary\n",
    "An experiment was conducted in which potential Udacity students were diverted by cookie into two groups, experiment and control. The experiment group was asked to input the amount of time they are willing to devote to study, after clicking a \"start free trial button\", whereas the control group was not. Three invariant metrics (Number of Cookies, Number of clicks on \"start free trial\", and Click-Through-Probability) were chosen for purposes of validation and sanity checking while Gross Conversion (enrollment/cookie) and Net Conversion (payments/cookie) served as evaluation metrics. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the evaluation metrics between the groups, futhermore, a practical signifcance threshold was set for each metric. The requirement for launching the experiment is that the null hypothesis must be rejected for ALL evaluation metrics and that the difference between branches must meet or exceed the practical signficance threshold. Because our acceptance criteria requires statiscally signifcant differences for ALL evaluation metrics, the use of the Bonferonni correction is not appropriate. The Bonferonni correction is a method for controlling for type I errors (false positives) when using multiple metrics in which relevance of ANY of the metrics matches the hypothesis. In this case the risk of type I errors increases as the number of metrics increases (signifcance by random chance). In our case in which ALL metrics must be relevant to launch, the risk of type II errors (false negatives) increases as the number of metrics increases, so it stands to reason that controlling for false positives is not consistent with our acceptance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis revealed the expected equal distribution of cookies into the control and experimental groups, for the invariant metrics, at the 95% CI. A difference in gross conversion was found to be statistically signficant at the 95% CI, and the null hypothesis was rejected. Gross conversion also met the practical signficance threshold. Net Conversion was found to be neither statistically nor practically signficant at the 95% CI.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendation\n",
    "This experiment was designed to determine whether filtering students as a function of study time commitment would improve the overall student experience and the coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course, without significantly reducing the number of students who continue past the free trial. A statistically and practically signficant decrease in Gross Conversion was observed but with no significant differences in Net Conversion. This translates to a decrease in enrollment not coupled to an increase in students staying for the requisite 14 days to trigger payment. Considering this, my recomendation is not to launch, but rather to pursue other experiments.\n",
